The Society for Ecosystem Restoration Northern British Columbia (SERNbc) organization testing file upload and download workflows for Skeena Knowledge Trust (SKT) CKAN data portal.  
  

An API key is required and is stored in a file outside of github.    
  

This was set up on a windows machine and is using the git large file storage (lfs) tool that is downloaded separately with the setup pulled off by running the get-setup.sh script.
